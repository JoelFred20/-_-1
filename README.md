IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
Introduction
This GitHub repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating a simple machine learning workflow using the famous Iris dataset. The workflow covers data exploration, model training, evaluation, and visualization of decision boundaries. Two different classifiers are used: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

Contents
Installation of Necessary Libraries

Required libraries, such as scikit-learn and matplotlib, are installed in a code cell.
Importing Libraries

Essential libraries, including numpy, pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn, are imported for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning tasks.
Loading and Exploring the Iris Dataset

The Iris dataset is loaded, and its features are explored. The data is converted into a DataFrame for better visualization.
Visualizing Data

Various visualizations, including pairplots, boxplots, and violinplots, are created to provide insights into the distribution of features and relationships between classes.
Splitting the Data

The dataset is split into training and testing sets using scikit-learn's train_test_split function.
Initializing and Training the SVM Model

An SVM model with a linear kernel is initialized and trained using the training data.
Making Predictions

The trained SVM model is used to make predictions on the test data.
Evaluating the Model

The performance of the SVM model is assessed using metrics such as accuracy and a classification report.
Visualizing Decision Boundaries

Decision boundaries of the SVM model are visualized using matplotlib and scikit-learn.
Making Predictions using KNN Model

A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model is created, trained, and evaluated on the Iris dataset.
